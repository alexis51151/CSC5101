# CSC5101 - Advanced Programming of Multicore Architectures

Set of exercises from [CSC5101 course](http://www-inf.telecom-sudparis.eu/cours/chps/paam/) at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) to perfect my C parallel programming skills and delve deeper into the following research topics :

* **Threads and synchronization:** producer/consumer design pattern implementation
* **Lock algorithms:**  lock implementations and benchmarking for POSIX, spinlock, ticket and MCS locks
* **Non-blocking algorithms:** implementing a lock-free queue while resolving the ABA problem when freeing nodes
* **Transactional memory:** implementing a software transactional memory and hazard pattern to free memory
* **Non-uniform memory (NUMA) architecture:** benchmarking memory reads in a NUMA architecture for different workloads 
* **Non-volatile memory:** simulating a NVMM mapping a persistent file into memory and implementing a write-cache
